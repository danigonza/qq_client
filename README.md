# QQ Client for Ruby

This gem si based in the gem [qq_17up](https://github.com/17up/qq_17up) made by [veggie](mailto:kkxlkkxllb@gmail.com).

The difference is that the configurations for the qq client is inside the rails configration in a ruby file instead of being stored in `/config/service.ym`.

This is the first step to build a gem to communicate with the qq connect open platform API.

The gem includes an strategy for connect qq via omniauth. 

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'qq_client'
```

Then `bundle install`

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install qq_client
```
## Setup

To configure the gem create the file `config/initializers/qq_client_config.rb` and add the configuration of the client.

Example:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  QQ_CONNECT_API_KEY = {API Key} unless defined?(QQ_CONNECT_API_KEY)
  QQ_CONNECT_API_SECRET = {API Secret} unless defined?(QQ_CONNECT_API_SECRET)
  QQ_CONNECT_REDIRECT_URI = {Callback redirect url} unless defined?(QQ_CONNECT_REDIRECT_URI)

  QqClient::Config.load_config(QQ_CONNECT_API_KEY, QQ_CONNECT_API_SECRET, QQ_CONNECT_REDIRECT_URI)
end
```

## OmniAuth configuration

To use qq_connect with devise omniauth please add to the `config/initializers/devise.rb`:

```ruby
  require 'omniauth/strategies/qq_connect'
  ...
  config.omniauth :qq_connect, ENV['TQQ_KEY'], ENV['TQQ_SECURT']
```

## Usage

Frst of all create a QqClient::Client with a access_token provided by qq. The you can start getting the info.

You must have the uid before. This elemtn is provided during the oauth flow.

```ruby
# Building the client for this spsecific user
client = QqClient::Client.new(access_token)

# Get Tencent Weibo user's login information.
# More info (http://wiki.connect.qq.com/get_info)
user_info = client.get_info(uid)

# Published a microblogging message (plain text) to the Tencent microblogging platforms.
# More info (http://wiki.connect.qq.com/add_t)
client.add_t(uid, 'Text message')

# Upload a picture and posted a message on the Tencent microblogging platforms.
# More info (http://wiki.connect.qq.com/add_pic_t)
client.add_pic_t(uid, 'Text message', pic)
```
